Title: Combining genetic and non-genetic data in identification cases
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Alf Erik and Thore

Description: DNA based solutions may by symmetric. For instance,
    if two brothers are missing, it may be impossible to determine using DNA
    which is the missing person.
    Discrete data (like presence of a tattoo) or continuous (like age) information 
    may resolve such symmetries and this is addressed in the package.
